IT Capstone Project 2020

Group work by three programmers and two networkers. Our group chose the name "Bacch Group" for it's company.

Create a job proposal for an upcoming Hotel/restaurant combo. The hotel is named Capstone264Hotel. The restaurant is named GGs.
The group will respond to a Request for Information with a Letter of Interest. A request for proposal follows, giving Bacch Group
all of the necessary guidelines for the proposal.

A floor plan is to be created with guidance for how the hotel and restaurant layout should be designed, along with where technology should
be placed. This includes card reader locks and keypad locks on doors, computers, printers, networking drops, routers, wifi, server room,
and wiring closets. This includes POS systems in the restaurant. 

A Gantt Chart is to be created.
A budget which includes software, licensing, hardware, and wages and fees from Bacch Group will be created.

A front-end website for the restaurant should be created using images from the Digital Arts department.
The website must display a home page with information, a page with hours and a map to the location, and a page displaying the full menu.

A back-end website should be created for employees to access.
Back-end should be an Admin/employer portal connected to a database.
It should have a login page with user credentials and proper input validation.
The portal should have pages for inserts, edits, and deletes, depending on user permissions level.
Tables should include users, employees, orders, order details, menu items, and inventory.
